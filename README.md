# VoiceContent
Adds content to Content Warning via voice recognition

## Dependencies
This depends on my fork of [VoiceRecognitionAPI](https://github.com/NotestQ/VoiceRecognitionAPI) for Content Warning and [Mycelium](https://github.com/RugbugRedfern/Mycelium-Networking-For-Content-Warning)

## Contributing
This is my actual first time making a git repo, programming specifically in C# AND modding an Unity game so bear with me if something is wrong, multiple things probably are

If you'd like to build the mod for yourself:
 - Clone the repo
 - Set your references
 - Then contribute??
 - Build like you would a normal mod
